The site is clean and easy to understand. For our younger audience, we have added a translation button to the Swedish language that is compatible with the game.

_Counter_
-Underneath the game you will see a green “Right” and red “wrong”, these will calculate how many times you have bet on the correct side of the coin and how many times you picked the wrong side. 


### Testing 
I have been doing alot of test to check if the site is working right. The first way of doing in was to click on the Heads button 50 times and then the Tails button 50 times and check in Chrome dev tool if it pop up any syntaxError or any sort of error wich it didn´t and exactly the same on the Swedish version. Then looked if the counter i have fixed is correct by track how many correct i have and see if they match. 


## Validator test

-HTML 
 - One Error did i find in the HTML and it was the charset=utf-8 that i dont understand why and it doesnt effect the website in anyway.
-CSS
 - No errors came back from the Jigsaw.
